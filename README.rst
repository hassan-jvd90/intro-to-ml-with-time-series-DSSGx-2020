Introduction to Machine Learning with Time Series
=================================================

This is the repository for the "Introduction to Machine Learning with Time
Series" tutorial in Python during Data Science for Social Good at The Alan
Turing Institute (DSSGx) 2020.

You'll learn about:

* How to tell apart different learning time series learning problems (or tasks) that arise in a temporal data setting,
* How to do exploratory data analysis for time series,
* How to build machine learning models to solve these tasks (using `sktime <https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime>`_ and other Python toolboxes),

We assume familiarity with the standard tabular machine learning setting
covered by `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_, but no prior
experience of working with time series.

How to get started
------------------
You can run the notebooks on Binder_ without having to install anything.

Alternatively, you can `clone <https://help.github
.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a
-repository>`_ this repository and run the notebooks locally. This requires
a working Python installation (e.g. `Anaconda distribution <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/>`_) with `Jupyter notebooks <https://jupyter.org/install>`_.

Feedback
--------
Feedback is highly appreciated. If you've found an error, if we've missed
anything or if you want to suggest something new, please `raise an issue
<https://github.com/mloning/intro-to-ml-with-time-series-DSSGx-2020/issues/new
/choose>`_.
